Breadcrumbs project for Software Product Engineering

## Structure

- /android : android application used by early-career members providing the gamification of the 'breadcrumbs trail'.
- /web : web application used by experts to monitor the completion of the 'breadcrumb trail' by the early-career members.

## Overview

As part of enhancing the experience of event delegates and making events more immersive we have been exploring Augmented Reality. One application under consideration is the creation of a breadcrumb trail for early career scientists and clinicians to take a quiz around a venue and eventually pair up with a senior member over a coffee to discuss their answers (and ask more questions). The idea is that early career members will have some experience of AR and game play, while senior members have the knowledge (and the questions and answers) these members need. By mixing in an element of play in to the icebreaker we hope to put all parties at ease and seed the encounter with some opening questions and answers.
