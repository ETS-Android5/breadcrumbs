Evaluation
==========

For our evaluation, we did not have direct access to the target demographic of our product. Luckily, we managed to arrange this through our client. Every 2 weeeks, he conducted on-site user tests and give us the feedback. This feedback focused on look, feel and functionality which helped us to detect bugs such as the app not working at first on older versions of Android as well as add features that we overlooked such as not all phones being able to support QR code scanning. Messaging via LinkedIn was used to obtain real-time feedback.

We identified that a simple way of adding in targets (the location of a hint/question) was needed as we couldn't use conventional GPS technology. To solve this problem, we came up with the idea of admins being able to enter in coordinates on the venue map which will be uploaded onto the database.

This form of evaluation had its positives and negatives. Because we were not physically there, we were not able to chime in which could've corrupted the feedback. Leaving the end users to do it themselves allowed for more honest feedback. Doing it over messaging also allowed for a much quicker deployment turnover as we wouldn't have been able to get bi-weekly feedback as quickly if we had to travel there and back.

However, the downside of this is that we might not have been able to get more detailed feedback (e.g what a specific person thought) as it had all been collated. Also most of this data was collected on rough notes, a method which was suitable for our team of 4 but might not have been able to scale if we were a larger group. A more organised way of acting on this feedback might have been better.
