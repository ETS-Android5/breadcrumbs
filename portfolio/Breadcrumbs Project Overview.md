# Breadcrumbs Project Overview

BioScientifica are the commercial subsidiary of the Society for Endocrinology, a non-profit organisation supporting career members working in the field of endocrinology. Working with experts in this field, along with pharmaceutical companies, they regularly host events popular with early-career members looking for jobs and new oppurtunities.

The problem that BioScientifica face is that it is often difficult to start conversation between the early-career members and experts at their events. The solution they wish us to implement aims to bridge this gap and act as an icebreaker between the two parties.

Breadcrumbs is an Android application we shall develop to solve this problem. It aims to gamify the event space for early-career members through a trail of 'breadcrumbs' consisting of multiple-choice questions and hints, with the trail ending with a meeting with one of the expert members.

A system shall be developed along side the game to allow the experts and event managers to both view how the game's users are progressing, but also allow the contents of the breadcrumbs to be customised. This should allow the application to be easily modified for the numerous events BioScientifica run throughout the year.

Through searching the venue for physical questions and clues to help find and  answer them, whilst receiving a scoring incentives, the Breadcrumbs application shall gamify the event experience for early-career members. This, along with experts being able to view their answers as they progress, should act as a starting point for conversation for their meeting allowing a better connection to be made.
